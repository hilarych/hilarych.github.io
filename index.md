I am right now a seismologist doing postdoctoral research at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.

My research interests are

- Source characterization for small to moderate earthquakes.
-	Near-surface structure.
-	Ambient noise seismology.
-	Fiber-optic seismology.
-	Applications in reservoir and fault monitoring, geothermal exploration, and carbon storage.

In my free time, I like paddling, sailing on the Charles River, and rollerblading along the riverside.
