## About Me

I am a 6th-year PhD student studying geophysics and seismology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

My research interests are

- Source characterization for small to moderate earthquakes.
-	Near-surface structure (Fig. 1,2).
-	Ambient noise seismology.
-	Fiber-optic seismology (Fig. 3).
-	Applications in reservoir and fault monitoring, geothermal exploration, and carbon storage.

In my free time, I like paddling (Fig. 4), sailing on the Charles River, and rollerblading along the riverside.
